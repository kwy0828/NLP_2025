# NLP_2025

This repository contains a simple Python script for basic natural language processing practice.

## `nlp_practice.py`

The script implements a small Naive Bayes classifier using only Python's standard library. It uses a tiny sample dataset of positive and negative sentences and demonstrates how to tokenize text, train the classifier, and predict sentiment.

### Usage

```
python3 nlp_practice.py "Your sentence here"
```

If no sentence is provided on the command line, the script will prompt for input.
